# SuperheroHunter(Using javascript)
New repo
The "Superhero Hunter" project is a fun web application that allows users to search for superheroes and villains from popular comic universes and get information about them, such as their name, biography, abilities, and appearance. To build this project, you'll need to use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, along with a superhero API to fetch the data.
